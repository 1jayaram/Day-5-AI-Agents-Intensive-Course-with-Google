# Day 5 Prototype to Production

During the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google, I developed a prototype and learned how to convert it into production by completing codelabs on Kaggle.

Day 5a - Agent2Agent Communication

What I learnt during the 5th day,
1. Focused on moving agentic systems from local prototypes to scalable, enterprise-ready solutions.
2. Built multi-agent systems that communicate via Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol.
3. Deployed agents to production using Vertex AI Agent Engine on Google Cloud, covering real-world productionization challenges.
